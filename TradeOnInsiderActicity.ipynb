    "#### Legal Insider Trading\n",
    "Insiders have different kinds of information advantages. First, they know in advance which major events will affect stock prices. This type of advantage disappears after the events are announced, usually within a short time. Second, insiders can better assess the company’s earnings prospects and growth potential than outsiders. This type of information advantage is usually long term and does not rely on specific events. Third, insiders can better assess the intrinsic value of a company than outsiders and can thus identify and exploit opportunities when the stock market overvalues or undervalues the company. Fourth, insiders have a better sense of industry and macro-economy trends and thus tend to predict future macroeconomic directions more accurately. The first three types of advantages can increase insiders’ ability to predict firm-level price movement more precisely. They seem to always be able to cash in when the price is high and purchase when the price is low. The fourth advantage increases aggregate insiders’ ability to time the market. According to STOCK ACT, US senators are required to disclose their stock trade publicly, and we can obtain the stock trade feed including the file and transaction dates, stock issuers, lower and higher bound for trade size, and transaction side from the Securities and Exchange Commision(SEC) website.
